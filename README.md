# Metis Project 4: Unsupervised Learning on Food.com Recipes and Reviews

#### Use NLP and unsupervised learning techniques to find relationships between recipes and their reviews

##  Packages Used

pandas: Python package for data manipulation and analysis
numpy: fundamental package for scientific computing in Python
matplotlib: plotting and visualization package for Python

##  The project

Clean the text for topic modeling, process the topic scores and recipe metadata through k-means clustering,  move to tableau for further visualizations. Use clusters and k-means predict function to build framework of basic recommender system, taking in a new recipe, putting it through the same text processing and topic modeling pipeline as the training recipes, and return a random recipe found in the predicted cluster.
